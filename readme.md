# WuBook – Personal Error Book

WuBook is a lightweight web application designed to help you capture, review, and learn from your child's mistakes in math, physics, and physical exercises. Add detailed notes, attach photos, and keep everything searchable in one place.

## Features

- 📚 **Structured entries** – Track subject, exercise title, description, reason, corrective notes, tags, and timestamps.
- 🖼️ **Photo attachments** – Add snapshots of worksheets or physical activities.
- 🔍 **Smart suggestions** – Find similar exercises with built-in text similarity (no external services required).
- 🧭 **Powerful filters** – Search by keyword and filter by subject.
- 💾 **Local storage** – Everything is saved in your browser automatically.
- 📤 **Import & export** – Backup entries to JSON and import them later.
- ✏️ **Inline editing** – Update notes as your child improves.

## Getting started

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your favourite browser.
3. Start logging mistakes! Entries are saved locally and stay there even after closing the tab.

## Tips

- Use descriptive tags such as `fractions`, `careless`, or `timing` to make filters more powerful.
- Export regularly so you can share the archive or keep a cloud backup.
- The similarity finder works best when the description, reason, and notes contain meaningful context.

## Tech stack

This project is a static web app written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript—no build tools or dependencies required.
